# mario
A collection of programs to play the Mario theme song.

## Why?
The first fun program that I ever created was the `mario.sas` macro. The goal
at the time was to try to set up a cron job to play this macro to try the sys
admin crazy (the server resided in his office). Because this first sparked my
interest in programming. Though it would be fun to share and see how many languages
could implement the song.
